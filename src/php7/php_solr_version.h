 * Extension version numbers using hexadecimal numbers
 *
 * This is the numeric version of the extension, meant for easier
 * parsing and comparisons by programs. The PHP_SOLR_VERSION_ID define will
 * always follow this syntax:
 *
 * 0xXXYYZZ
 *
 * Where XX, YY and ZZ are the main version, minor version and patch numbers in
 * hexadecimal (using 8 bits each). All three numbers are always represented
 * using two digits.  1.2 would appear as "0x010200" while version 9.11.7
 * appears as "0x090b07".
 *
 * This 6-digit (24 bits) hexadecimal number does not show pre-release number,
 * and it is always a greater number in a more recent release. It makes
 * comparisons with greater than and less than work.
