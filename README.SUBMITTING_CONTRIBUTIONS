Submitting contributions
================================================================================

A lot of time has been put into designing, implementing and documenting this extension.

A lot of work has also been put into ensuring that users of the extension
experience very minimal defects during usage.

New ideas, corrections, bug fixes, feature improvements are always welcome.

However, you must discuss any changes you are about to make to any of 
the source files prior to making or submitting such changes either in the
PECL developers mailing list (pecl-dev@lists.php.net) or by contacting the 
current author(s) or maintainer(s) of this extension directly.

Test scripts should be included when making the submissions.

Also explain thoroughly what has been fixed/added/changed by your patch.

If your patch is easy to review and has obviously no side-effects,
it might take up to a few hours until it is committed.

Since this is a volunteer-driven effort, more complex patches will
require more patience on the part of the submitter.

================================================================================
Testing thoroughly before submissions
================================================================================

This is a fairly large library and each component is dependent on another
component either directly or indirectly.

As a consequence, any and all changes must be tested thoroughly before commiting them.

It is only polite to the users, author(s) or maintainer(s) that you do so.
